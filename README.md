#  Bank System Risk Analysis

This project is about analyzing potential risks of a bank system. Given bank's assets, our goal is to find vulnerabilities, threats and impacts
that these assets may cause on the bank system. After this presentation, we estimate the severity of these vulnerabilities
 and we suggest possible solutions to limit damage and business impact.
